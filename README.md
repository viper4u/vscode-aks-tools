# vscode-aks-tools

NOTE: Hi there! This is a fork of azure/vscode-aks-tools, which is totally normal and fine, especially for local work and for creating and submitting PRs to upstream, which we hope you will do! But...... you published this extension in the VS code marketplace (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Viper4u.vscode-aks-tools-fork-viper4u&ssr=false#overview), without modifying much of anything except the publisher name. That's not really playing fairly with either the people who created and contributed to the upstream repository or to the world of users who might be searching for it. 

Can we get an explanation for the publication? Were you just testing out how this all worked? I've submitted this pr to you in order to have that conversation. We would LOVE to get any feature you think is missing into the upstream version -- collaborators are always welcome, and if you want to add your own custom functionality, you can easily do that independently with the VS Code Kubernetes Extension API. That will mean you don't even NEED to fork the upstream extension. 

Love to have the chat in the PR comments, or feel free to ping me at ralph[dot]squillace[at]microsoft[dot]com. 

Chat you soon I hope, 

Ralph
